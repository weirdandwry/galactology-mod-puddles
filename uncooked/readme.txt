Here you can find a TexturePacker example of how to pack images for use inside the game. UI images don't need to be packed, but since the game supports arbitrary per-entity unique images and poses, anything displayed on-map as part of the gameplay must be packed and aliased, to keep save files portable.

Don't include non-final assets in your mods! This is here only to serve as an example.
